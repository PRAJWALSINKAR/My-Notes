Code Review
++++++++++++++

-> In project development multiple team members will be involved

-> Some developers will be freshers, some are junior developers & some are senior developers

-> As a developer we might do some mistakes in coding or we may not follow proper coding standards

-> We will perform Code Review to identify the mistakes of the developers in coding

-> With the help of code review we can provide quality code and bug free code

-> To perform code review we will use Sonar Qube software


-> The  process of reviewing the code to identify developers mistakes 
-> code review will happen in 2 ways 
	1) using tool
	2) peer review 


##############
Sonar Qube
##############

-> Sonar Qube is an automatic code review tool

-> Sonar Qube supports for 29 programming languages

-> Sonar Qube will identify

        1) Bugs
        2) Vulnerabilities
        3) Code Smells
        4) Duplicate Code Blocks

Note : 1) SonarQube will not check our logic is correct or not 
       2) Junior developer code checking will done by senior developer in the team.
	This is called as peer review. Peer Review is a manual process. In peer review,
	logic checking will be done
 
-> download SonarQube after that  go to the file 
C:\Users\tejas\Downloads\sonarqube-25.7.0.110598\sonarqube-25.7.0.110598\bin\windows-x86-64 
run cmd 
-> StartSonar.bat
-> http://localhost:9000
first use username -> admin
pwd -> admin 

then set
username - admin  ( change it also)
 pwd  -Gangdq@866939


mail-> tejassinkar24

Note:go to  http://localhost:9000 and create new token 
 

step A:try this first is it is not working then try step B by Skipping step  A
======

Boot App ->      sonar server ==> Report
-> to add project to sonar ,go to project directory -> cmd -> mvn clean package
-> mvn sonar:sonar




step B: go to project folder open cmd there and execute below command
=======
mvn clean verify sonar:sonar ^
  -Dsonar.projectKey=02_MiniProject_App-1 ^
  -Dsonar.host.url=http://localhost:9000 ^
  -Dsonar.login=sqa_2d7c093120bb004ba383575ad609ef1df6fb63e6   //paste your token 


fix issues available in sonar issues
 
JUnits implementation


Notes To write Good code:

===============================
1) if(user.getGender().equals("Male")){
	//logic
}else{
	//logic
}

#above code give null pointer exception as user.getGender() can give null value 


if("Male".equals(user.getGender()){
}
else{
}
#this above code will not give null pointer exception else condition will execute

2)Either log or rethrow the exception i.e  instead of printtracktrace use logger

3) Instead of Math.random() use java.util.Random.nextInt() method to generate random number 

4) Dont use "password"  or "pwd" in our code directory .It will be considered as vulnerable.
Use pazzword or pzzwd for variable names
  
5) Declare variable before constructor

6) Replace stingBuffer with StingBuilder to improve performance
StringBuffer -> is Syncronized (only one thread access at a time)
StringBuilder -> is not synchronized( multiple  thread access at a time)

8) remove un-necessary curly braces from lambda when we have single line

9) follow camel case for variable names declaration.

10) Declare private constructor for class if it is not getting instantiated anywhere.


HW: DO code review for all project
