Software development Life Cycle(SDLC)
-------------------------------------

=> From start to end is called as life Cycle.
=> SDLC -> Development + Testing + Deployment + Delivery

=> From Project Start to till Project end is called as SDLC.

=> we have server phases in SDLC

  4)Development
  5)Testing
  6)Deployment
  7)Delivery

-------------------
SDLC Methodologies :-
-------------------

1) Waterfall(Outdated)
2) Agile(Most Trending)

======================
Waterfall Methodology  :-
---------------------

-> Linear Methodology
-> It is a step by step process.
-> After one step is Completed then only we will move to next step
-> Forward Direction
-> Client involvement is very less
-> Client will see project at the end
-> requirements fixed & budget fixed.
 
==============
Agile Method :-
--------------

 -> Iterative approach  
-> Development + Testing + Delivery - is a cyclic process  
-> Project will be delivered in multiple phases (Sprint)  
-> Client Involvement will be there in every phase of the project  
-> Requirements are not fixed & Budget is not fixed

Note : Client Satisfaction is most Important in this Model  

====================
Agile Terminology :-
--------------------

Product Owner : Responsible to deliver project to client (Delivery Head)
 
Scrum Master  : Responsible to Manage Agile team Work (Daily Tracking)

Tech Lead     : Seniour Resouce in Team For Technical Help

Team Members  : Developers + Testers + DB Team + Ops Team
